# AirCulator
A calculator that you can use in the air :)  This project will hopefully be using hand detection in order to calculate simple maths. 

### Steps in creating the customised model

Firstly, I searched up google's gesture recognisiton as a guide point (Link can be found here: https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/gesture_recognizer/python#video ) This led me to a link that allowed me to customise my own model using this link : https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/customization/gesture_recognizer.


## Current update on the project
Date - 30/08/24

I'm currently working on training my own model so that it can detect my own hand signals.
 I've finished collecting data and will now work on training the AI model. I'm thinking of either using Voice detection for the mathmatical symbols. OR a screen with the symbols

 wild ride today, I spent so much time on finding the right versions because of failed library installations. I have made a requirement folder that worked for me, but please do try and see what works for you.

 Don't try to attemp to to run the training code on your laptop as google.colab doesn't work unless you run it in the google colab environment. I recommend you upload your folder( that is structured similar to the sample folder provided in the repo )to to Google Drive, then run the code they provide here: https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlesamples/mediapipe/blob/main/examples/customization/gesture_recognizer.ipynb#scrollTo=sx8PsrwYjvgO. I'll also have an example of the code in the repo.
