# AirCulator
A calculator that you can use in the air :)  This project will hopefully be using hand detection in order to calculate simple maths. 

### Steps in creating the customised model

Firstly, I searched up google's gesture recognisiton as a guide point (Link can be found here: https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/gesture_recognizer/python#video ) This led me to a link that allowed me to customise my own model using this link : https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/customization/gesture_recognizer.


## Current update on the project
Date - 26/08/24

I'm currently working on training my own model so that it can detect my own hand signals.
 I'm collecting data to train the model. This is consuming a lot of time, so I'm assuming at least a week or even two just to collect data.
